v0.03: the speed of v0.01 and the robustness of v0.02.

Thanks to Graham Barr for pointing out a better way to cope with
exceptions.


NAME
       Algorithm::FastPermute - Rapid generation of permutations

SYNOPSIS
         use Algorithm::FastPermute ('permute');
         my @array = (1..shift());
         permute {
             print "@array\n";         # Print all the permutations
         } @array;


DESCRIPTION
       Algorithm::FastPermute generates all the permutations of
       an array. You pass a block of code, which will be executed
       for each permutation.

       It's very fast. My tests suggest it's four or five times as
       fast as Algorithm::Permute.

EXPORT
       The `permute' function is exported by default.
