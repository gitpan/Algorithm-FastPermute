| Algorithm::FastPermute v0.99    - Robin Houston, 2005-10-31
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a beta release of (what will become) version 1.0.
It uses the proposed MULTICALL interface where available,
and emulates it otherwise. This fixes a number of bugs.

NAME
       Algorithm::FastPermute - Rapid generation of permutations

SYNOPSIS
         use Algorithm::FastPermute ('permute');
         my @array = (1..shift());
         permute {
             print "@array\n";         # Print all the permutations
         } @array;


DESCRIPTION
       Algorithm::FastPermute generates all the permutations of
       an array. You pass a block of code, which will be executed
       for each permutation.

       It's very fast. My tests suggest it's four or five times as
       fast as Algorithm::Permute's traditional interface.

EXPORT
       The `permute' function is exported by default.
