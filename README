-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.06: Now works on older (5.005) and newer (5.8.x) versions
of Perl. Thanks to Richard Clamp, Edwin Pratomo, Jørn Amundsen,
Yves Orton and Murat Ünalan for reporting problems.

Note: A version of this implementation is also provided by the
Algorithm::Permute module.


NAME
       Algorithm::FastPermute - Rapid generation of permutations

SYNOPSIS
         use Algorithm::FastPermute ('permute');
         my @array = (1..shift());
         permute {
             print "@array\n";         # Print all the permutations
         } @array;


DESCRIPTION
       Algorithm::FastPermute generates all the permutations of
       an array. You pass a block of code, which will be executed
       for each permutation.

       It's very fast. My tests suggest it's four or five times as
       fast as Algorithm::Permute's traditional interface.

EXPORT
       The `permute' function is exported by default.
